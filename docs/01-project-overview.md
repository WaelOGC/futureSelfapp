# Project Overview: FutureSelfApp

## What is FutureSelfApp?

FutureSelfApp is a web-based AI Services platform that provides users with access to multiple AI-powered services for creative, professional, and personal transformation. The platform offers a suite of AI Services that leverage advanced AI models to help users visualize their future, create content, and achieve their goals.

FutureSelfApp operates as a standalone product with its own brand identity, user accounts, payment system, and data ownership. All user interactions, generated content, and account information belong to FutureSelfApp as a product.

## Target Users

Future Self targets users aged **17-40** who are:

- **Creative Content Creators**: Social media creators, influencers, and content producers seeking AI-powered tools for visual and video content
- **Professional Users**: Individuals needing professional headshots, multilingual content, and business-oriented AI services
- **Personal Development Seekers**: People interested in self-reflection, future visualization, and goal achievement
- **Tech-Forward Individuals**: Early adopters comfortable with AI technology and willing to pay for premium AI tools

### Primary Use Cases

- Personal transformation and future visualization
- Professional headshot generation
- Social media content creation
- Multilingual video translation
- Creative scene and style transformation
- Viral content caption generation

## Business Model

FutureSelfApp operates on a **paid AI Services model** with the following monetization components:

### Credits System
- Users purchase credits to access AI Services
- Different tools consume different amounts of credits based on processing complexity
- Credits can be purchased in packages or through subscription plans

### Subscription Plans
- Recurring subscription options for regular users
- Tiered pricing based on usage levels
- Subscription benefits may include:
  - Monthly credit allocations
  - Discounted credit rates
  - Priority processing
  - Access to premium features

### Tool Pricing
- Each AI Service has a credit cost associated with its use
- Pricing reflects the computational complexity and API costs
- Users can see credit costs before generating content

## Relationship to OGC NewFinity

**OGC NewFinity** is the development company behind FutureSelfApp. The relationship is strictly **developer-to-product**:

- **OGC NewFinity**: The development company that builds and maintains FutureSelfApp
- **FutureSelfApp**: The standalone product brand that users interact with

### Key Distinctions

- Users see and interact with "Future Self" branding (user-facing), but technical documentation uses "FutureSelfApp"
- All marketing, user communications, and product identity use "Future Self" (user-facing branding)
- OGC NewFinity is not mentioned in user-facing materials
- The developer relationship is internal and technical only
- All user accounts, payments, and data belong to FutureSelfApp as a product entity

### Development Context

OGC NewFinity develops FutureSelfApp using:
- Flask (Python) backend
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS frontend
- Integration with multiple AI APIs (Replicate, OpenAI, and others)
- Modern web application architecture

## Product Vision

FutureSelfApp aims to be the go-to platform for AI-powered personal and creative transformation. The platform provides:

1. **Accessibility**: Easy-to-use tools that don't require technical expertise
2. **Quality**: High-quality AI outputs using state-of-the-art models
3. **Variety**: Multiple tools serving different use cases and audiences
4. **Reliability**: Consistent performance and user experience
5. **Privacy**: User data and generated content remain private and secure

## Current Status

- **Active Service**: The Time Capsule (photo aging + wisdom letter generation)
- **Planned Services**: Four additional AI Services in development
- **Platform**: Web application (Flask backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend)
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with service dashboard planned
