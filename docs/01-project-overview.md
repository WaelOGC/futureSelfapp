# Project Overview: Future Self

## What is Future Self?

Future Self is a web-based AI tools platform that provides users with access to multiple AI-powered services for creative, professional, and personal transformation. The platform offers a suite of tools that leverage advanced AI models to help users visualize their future, create content, and achieve their goals.

Future Self operates as a standalone product with its own brand identity, user accounts, payment system, and data ownership. All user interactions, generated content, and account information belong to Future Self as a product.

## Target Users

Future Self targets users aged **17-40** who are:

- **Creative Content Creators**: Social media creators, influencers, and content producers seeking AI-powered tools for visual and video content
- **Professional Users**: Individuals needing professional headshots, multilingual content, and business-oriented AI services
- **Personal Development Seekers**: People interested in self-reflection, future visualization, and goal achievement
- **Tech-Forward Individuals**: Early adopters comfortable with AI technology and willing to pay for premium AI tools

### Primary Use Cases

## Business Model

Future Self operates on a **paid AI tools model** with the following monetization components:
